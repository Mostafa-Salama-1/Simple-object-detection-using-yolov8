<h1 align="center">Real-Time Face Recognition System with YOLOv8</h1>

<p align="center">
  This project is a <strong>real-time face recognition system</strong> built using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) model for object detection and recognition. The system uses a laptop camera to detect faces in real time, leveraging the power of deep learning for fast and accurate face recognition.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the setup, training, and real-time deployment of YOLOv8 for face recognition. It’s a useful project for those interested in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time object detection.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Face Detection:</strong> Uses your laptop’s camera for live face detection.</li>
  <li><strong>YOLOv8 Model:</strong> Leverages the latest advancements in the YOLO model series for high-speed, high-accuracy face recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Python and Ultralytics Library:</strong> Built with Python, using the <code>ultralytics</code> library for simplified model implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.8 or higher</li>
  <li><code>ultralytics</code> library</li>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Salama-1/Real-Time-Face-Recognition-YOLOv8.git
cd Real-Time-Face-Recognition-YOLOv8</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Install the required packages:
    <pre><code>pip install ultralytics opencv-python</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    <pre><code>jupyter notebook YOLO.ipynb</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the steps in the notebook to load the YOLOv8 model, access the laptop's camera, and run real-time face recognition.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The notebook provides sample outputs of real-time face recognition. When you run the notebook, you should see the camera feed with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Special thanks to the open-source contributors of the YOLOv8 model and the <code>ultralytics</code> library for their support in creating powerful tools for object detection and computer vision.</p>
